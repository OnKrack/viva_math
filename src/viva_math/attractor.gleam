//// Attractor dynamics for emotional states.
////
//// Based on Mehrabian's PAD model (1996) and dynamical systems theory.
//// Emotions form attractors in PAD space - stable states the system tends toward.
////
//// The 8 basic emotions correspond to the octants of the PAD cube:
//// - Joy:     (+P, +A, +D)
//// - Sadness: (-P, -A, -D)
//// - Anger:   (-P, +A, +D)
//// - Fear:    (-P, +A, -D)
//// - Surprise: (+P, +A, -D) or (-P, +A, -D)
//// - Disgust: (-P, -A, +D)
//// - Trust:   (+P, -A, +D)
//// - Anticipation: (+P, +A, +D)
